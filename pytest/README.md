This is the pytest file used for code testing.

You can execute the test by running `pytest test_code.py` in this directory.

This tests the functionality of the following functions in the main program:
* Finding duplicate songs
* Displaying songs
* Creating a list of the songs
* Exporting song information in CSV format
* Copying songs to another directory
* Renaming directories & pertinent lines in the song.dta files

It also cleans up the files created for testing the CSV export and copying functionality
